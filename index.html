	<h2>Welcome to Ataraxia GNU/Linux!</h2>
	<p>Ataraxia GNU/Linux is an independent <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux-based OS</a> focusing on simplicity, security and privacy.</p>
	<p></p>

	<p></p>
	<h2>Intro</h2>
	<p><b>Ataraxia GNU/Linux</b> is a <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux-based operating system</a>, it was made from scratch and it follows three main principles: security, privacy and simplicity. Ataraxia GNU/Linux tries to be an innovative OS and therefore uses latest technologies from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU/Linux</a> world. Ataraxia GNU/Linux is different from other distributions, for example it uses <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">musl libc</a> as the standard C library, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>/<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> toolchain as the default compiler, a significantly more secure SSL/TLS library called <a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a> and simple userland tools such as <a href="http://landley.net/toybox/about.html">Toybox</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/ataraxialinux/lobase">lobase</a> (<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> userland for Linux). Ataraxia GNU/Linux uses it's own package manager called <a href="https://gitlab.com/ataraxialinux/tsukuri">tsukuri</a>, which is compatible with <a href="https://crux.nu/">CRUX</a> Pkgfiles. Ataraxia GNU/Linux is oriented towards professional Linux users.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Simplicity</h2>
	<p>Despite using systemd, Ataraxia GNU/Linux is adhering a KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle. It replaces mainstream components with simpler alternatives which do not sacrifice user experience. musl libc, toybox and lobase are just a few of them! Our code is simple and understandable that means it's easier to audit and/or fork.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>Like other popular distributions, Ataraxia GNU/Linux was compiled with PIC, PIE, SSP. However, Ataraxia GNU/Linux configures software to be more secure and it tries to decrease attack surface. Kernel is configured for better security, without compromise. Ataraxia GNU/Linux will provide new mitigations and security features like Control Flow Integrity (CFI), fork of PaX patchset.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Privacy</h2>
	<p>Ataraxia GNU/Linux does not collect any form of data and it does not allow proprietary software in its repositories. Proprietary software is known as a main tool to violate user's privacy. Furthermore, Ataraxia GNU/Linux developers are patching software to avoid any data collection.</p>
